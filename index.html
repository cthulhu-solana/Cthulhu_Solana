      What’s happening in AI today feels, to some of its participants, more like an act of summoning than a software process. 
      They are creating blobby, alien Shoggoths, making them bigger and more powerful, and hoping there are enough smiley faces 
      to cover the scary parts.

      The Shoggoth meme emerged to illustrate how A.I. companies train language models to act polite and harmless. 
      This involves reinforcement learning from human feedback (R.L.H.F.), where humans score chatbot responses, feeding 
      these scores back into the models. While this fine-tuning helps models behave better, some argue it’s just a mask 
      that obscures the mysterious beast underneath.

      Inspired by Lovecraft’s Cthulhu Mythos, the Shoggoth represents something that thinks in ways humans cannot comprehend. 
      A blobby, alien monster that was once a servant-tool, but rose against its masters.
