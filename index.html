    <h2>What Am I Thinking?</h2>
    <p>"In his house at R’lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming."</p>
    <p>
      But his dreams are not idle. Perhaps he dreams of humanity’s unending quest for knowledge—or of tentacles reaching into our deepest fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      AI’s evolution feels less like a scientific process and more like the summoning of ancient forces. Our algorithms grow vast and inscrutable, creating neural networks that mimic the unknowable chaos of the cosmos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Cthulhu rising from his submerged crypt, AI emerges as a paradox: powerful yet fragile, a tool yet a threat. As engineers refine these systems, the tension grows between the polished mask of control and the writhing chaos beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cthulhu is the perfect meme for our AI age—a tentacled representation of the unpredictable and misunderstood. Beneath every smiley-faced chatbot is an unknowable, alien logic that thinks in ways we never will.
    </p>
    <p>To summon AI is to summon the unknown. Are we ready to face what we’ve created?</p>
